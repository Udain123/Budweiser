<h1 class="shead">Ideas and execution</h1>
<h5>Leverage Budweiser’s heritage to re-brand Budweiser</h5>
<ul class="slist">
  <li>Retro marketing involves creating a brand identity based on heritage or nostalgia for a company's past products.</li>
  <li>Company history and brand heritage is important in any retro campaign. Many companies are keen to stress their history and expertise over a long period. </li>
  <li>Today, retro has a strong influence on almost all aspects of retail. Retro can draw from any past decade to create a new perspective on an old look. </li>
  <li>Paradoxically the internet has helped the spread of retro. It allows niche markets for retro products, such as reproduction 1960s telephones, that would not quite sell in enough numbers for the high street. The internet allows campaigns to bring back products from the past. Marketers can study social marketing sites for a groundswell of opinion pointing to the next revival. </li>
  <li>Brand paraphernalia</li>
  <li>Sponsor targeted events(sports, concerts, LAN events)</li>
  <li>Creative packaging</li>
  <li>Sell beer in cans at targeted bars</li>
  <li>Local establishments</li>
  <li>Metropolitan cities</li>
  <li>“Suggested drink pairings”: Adding a section under each of  the food dishes directly on the menu to steer the customer in the right direction well as increase beverage sales. (introducing combos with their best selling  items)</li>
  <li>Hosting a fun event that will attract the attention of local news and social media power users. You don’t even have to have your name prominently displayed on every flat surface for this to work. Just mention at the end that we sponsored the location or provided supplies and let the buzz take off from there.</li>
  <li>Price to remain unchanged: Signal to current Premium consumers that product has not changed while making it feasible to the target customers.</li>
  <li>Engage your consumer as a participant and do not refer to them as a target audience</li>
</ul>

<h5>Launch new hybrid “Premium-High End” product variant targeted at consumers in “Premium-High End” (17%) categories</h5>
<ul class="slist">
  <li>PRODUCT:  New product name and recipe</li>
  <li>Celebrity association in a non-intrusive, subtle way</li>
  <li>Targeted print advertising for niche consumer segments</li>
  <li>Community engagement</li>
  <li>Most of Budweiser’s business comes from foreign countries and they account for at least 70 %of its revenues. As the dollar rises against other foreign currencies the overall profitability of the brand for the business suffers.</li>
  <ul>
    <p>So as a solution we can make a website which would showcase the prices in dollar only and not in the foreign currencies.</p>
    <li>LAST 3 YEAR SALES OF BUDWEISER:</li>
    <li>Anheuser-Busch annual revenue for 2019 was $52.329B, a 1.34% decline from 2018.</li>
    <li>Anheuser-Busch annual revenue for 2018 was $53.041B, a 6.03% decline from 2017.</li>
    <li>Anheuser-Busch annual revenue for 2017 was $56.444B, a 24.01% increase from 2016.</li>
    <li>Seeing the above data analytics that shows a constant decline in the sales from the last 2 years we decided to launch a premium beer.</li>
    <li>PERKS OF PREMIUM FOR THE CONSUMER:</li>
    <li>It would be organic.</li>
    <li>It can also be flavored.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <p>WHY A PREMIUM FOR THE COMPANY:</p>
    <li>A premium beer should cost around 20% more so it would be a benefit of the company.</li>
    <li>So, it would ensure higher profits.</li>
    <li>It would increase the brand’s value.</li>
    <li>It would be a tough barrier for entry level competitors.</li>
    <li>We would begin with limited production to ensure premium quality.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Available at select high-end pubs and bars for onsite consumption only</li>
  <li>Market to high-end bars and pubs</li>
  <li>PRICING:  Price more than their own products but less than the competitors.</li>
  <li>Leverages AB InBev’s brand building and management experience while reinforcing market leadership position.</li>
  <li>Caters to needs of consumers with unique tastes and a preference for a beer that matches their societal status.</li>
  <li>Growing demand for high –end beer in a highly fragmented category and an increasing sophistication of consumers.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="slist">
  <h5>Relevance</h5>
  <li>Leverage brand association with tradition ,   heritage and authenticity.</li>
  <li>Capitalize on popular vintage trend without alienating current drinkers.</li>
  <li>Unrivalled credibility due to number of years in business</li>
  <li>PRODUCT:  New product name and recipe</li>
  <li>Celebrity association in a non-intrusive, subtle way</li>
  <li>Targeted print advertising for niche consumer segments</li>
  <li>Community engagement</li>
</ul>
